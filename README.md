# Local Password Manager

This project is a locally-based Password Manager developed as part of a collaborative effort, with the main features allowing users to create, edit, and delete password entries securely stored within the application itself. 

## Project Motivation

Most password managers today are cloud-based, posing potential security risks if the cloud storage is compromised. We saw a need for a locally-based password manager to mitigate this vulnerability, offering users a more secure alternative by keeping all data strictly on their devices.

### Key Features

- **Local Storage**: Password entries are securely stored within the application, avoiding reliance on cloud storage.
- **Lightweight Design**: Many locally-based password managers can be resource-intensive, so we designed this application to be as lightweight as possible, minimizing system impact.
